# Description

Challenge created with the objective of modeling and implementing a simple Ad Network.

When creating a campaign, the advertiser can choose its conversion type: cpm, cpc or cpi,
depending on which event will be used to pay the Publisher.
1. CPM (Cost per mille impressions) - the advertiser pays a bid every time the publisher
displays the ad.
2. CPC (Cost per click) - the advertiser pays a bid every time there is a click on the ad.
3. CPI (Cost per install) - the advertiser pays a bid every time there is an install of the app
being advertised (after the ad was displayed and clicked)
